# Improvement-of-UGA-Bus-Application-User-Story

Website to project summary and collection: https://ejf25995.github.io/

Human Computer Interaction Summer 2022 group project with Hannah Tawashy, Erik Fulton, Matt Morris, and me (Kevin Nguyen). Throughout the course, we identified user stories that provided poor user experiences and workshopped potential solutions to improve them with user accessibilty in mind. Prior to mock-ups and prototyping, we created a pin board of as many user stories regardless of being good or bad, so there would be breadth in improvement and easing later developement with wider range of options to try and improve. Each of the 4 milestones were paired alongside a separate video demonstration of the work that was assigned over the course of weekly meetings showcasing the highlights of project development.
